( http://sauravag.com/2016/10/how-to-setup-turtlebot-simulator-in-ros-with-gazebo/ ):

First Simulation: Driving robot around and seeing kinect depth image.

    Open 4 terminal tabs.

    In terminal 1:$roscore

    In terminal 2:$roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

    In terminal 3:$roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch

    Instructions on how to change rviz settings for turtlebot sim are here
	(http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/03/3/ ).
	Once you read through the instructions, you will be able to see the kinect depth.

    In terminal 4:$roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

    Drive around by using your keyboard. Detailed instructions here
	( http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/03/5/ ).

Second Simulation: Mapping an environment by driving around it.

    Open 5 terminal tabs.

    In terminal 1:$roscore

    In terminal 2:$roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

    In terminal 3:$roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo gmapping_demo.launch

    In terminal 4:$roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch

    Follow instructions here ( http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/03/8/ ) to change cost map.

    In terminal 5:$roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

Drive around the robot to build your map. Now to save the map.

    Create a directory $mkdir ~/turtlebot_custom_maps
    $rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/turtlebot_custom_maps/tutorial

Now you may interrupt all processes except roscore.

Third Simulation: Autonomous driving

    In one terminal run:$roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
    In another terminal run:
    $roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/home/USERNAME/turtlebot_custom_maps/tutorial.yaml

    In another terminal run:
    $roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch

    Send a navigation goal to the robot by clicking on 2D Nav Goal button in rviz(in the top bar).
